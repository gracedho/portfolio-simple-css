            <p>hi! i’m grace ho. i’m a student at the university of michigan studying information science. 
            <br>since i’ve started college, i’ve grown more and more interested in cooking and in food. i truly believe that a home cooked meal is a type of magic on its own that shows love. because of that, my new year’s resolution for 2022 was to cook more! in addition to that, i’ve also been exploring more, traveling more, and trying new foods. 
            <br>keep up with my foodventures on my blog!</p>
